I just wanted to tell you a little bit about this site.

I used to write a lot more, and while most of that isn’t online anymore, maybe someday I’ll get around to cleaning it up enough to make it worth showing off.

I first started publishing at this domain in 2002. Back in those days, we used Movable Type, and damn it, we *liked* it! Then, if memory serves, I beta tested TypePad, maybe? After that, there was definitely a lot of WordPress.

These days, you're looking at a hastily built static site, generated by a [stupid static site generator](//github.com/freshyill/sssg) I made with Gulp.js and hosted on Github Pages.

Thanks!
