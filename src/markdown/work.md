Pictures can be pretty, but without seeing the thought and process that goes into defining and solving a problem, it’s impossible to know if the result is successful.

Starting with some very recent work (still in-progress, to be precise) I hope to build a showcase that can communicate the process as well as the result.

## Case study: *Science* search

**The problem:** *Science*’s existing search is built on Google’s Custom Search product, which is being phased out at the end of March 2018. A completely new back-end is being constructed in-house, and a new front-end was needed to complement the new features and solve problems with the existing search that we learned about through user feedback.

**The solution:** The audience for this product is very well defined: scientific researchers of all career stages. We need to connect them with the research content they rely on to stay informed and do their jobs.

    <p><b>The first step</b> in a successful search experience is to put high quality results in front of the user as quickly as possibly. For most users, this is the extent of what they need. They’ll hopefully find what they’re looking for and then move on. Most of this happens on the back-end.</p>

    <p>Our users have told us a lot about what they expect from a scholarly search, including that they’re willing to drill down to get to what they’re looking for. Researchers <i>expect</i> certain advanced options. We needed to make it easy to understand the pre-search options, as well as how to drill down into results.</p>

    <p>One additional feature we knew we’d want from the start is to swap the site’s standard alignment of thumbnail images, from the left-hand side to the right. The result is more scannable text, while keeping the image, which we’ve learned is useful to them.</p>

    <p>This quick sketch gets to the heart of what I knew we’d need to deliver: A search field, advanced search options, search results, and refinement options.</p>

    <p>Around this time, I also started to explore the more complicated form elements. <i>Science</i>’s content archive dates back to 1880, and a simple, yet powerful, date picker is essential to searching a range of dates. </p>

    <p><b>The third revision</b> builds on the second, focusing on the functionality of the fields and takes the existing layout of the site further into account. Additional detail in the margins uses information taken from discovery and requirements documentation. We’ve validated our basic concept and refined to the point where markers and paper won’t be of much more help. Time to commit this to the screen…</p>

    <p><b>The fourth revision</b> takes the concepts from the third and fourth revisions, and moves them to a Sketch wireframe. The fields are further refined, and the entire work begins to take on more of the look of the actual site design.</p>

    <p>It was always going to be difficult to get all of the essential elements and functionality enough visibility to allow for discoverability, so I gave the three-column layout from the second revision another try.</p>

    <p><b>The final revision</b> shows the form in both default and complete states. As the user performs a search, the facets appear inline below the fields they relate to. Time constraints dictated that we needed to begin development at this point. After a round of validation with internal users with a simple prototype (not shown, sorry), we were ready to start front-end integration.</p>

    <p><b>So what's next?</b> Time constraints dictated by the sunsetting of Google Custom Search and the need to keep pace with the back-end engineering necessitated a light touch when it came to up-front research. A impending initial release means we can now begin a second phase, with a baseline experience in place. Now we begin learning from what we have and plan for future iterations…</p>
